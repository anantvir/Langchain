### When to use this ? : When more granularity is required in embeddings

### Let's go through a simplified example to illustrate how ColBERT works.

Example Setup:
Query: "What is the capital of France?"
Document 1: "Paris is the capital of France."
Document 2: "Berlin is the capital of Germany."
### Step-by-Step Process:

### Tokenization and Encoding:

The query is tokenized into: ["What", "is", "the", "capital", "of", "France", "?"]
Document 1 is tokenized into: ["Paris", "is", "the", "capital", "of", "France", "."]
Document 2 is tokenized into: ["Berlin", "is", "the", "capital", "of", "Germany", "."]
These tokens are passed through BERT to generate embeddings for each token.
### Token-Level Embedding:

Let's denote the embeddings for query tokens as Q1, Q2, ..., Q7.
The embeddings for Document 1 tokens are D1_1, D1_2, ..., D1_7.
The embeddings for Document 2 tokens are D2_1, D2_2, ..., D2_7.
### Interaction via MaxSim:

For each query token, compute the dot product with each token in Document 1.
Suppose the similarities for Q1 with Document 1 tokens are [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.9, 0.5, 0.4, 0.1]. The max similarity for Q1 would be 0.9.
This process is repeated for all query tokens, resulting in a list of maximum similarities [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5, 0.9, 0.3].
The final score for Document 1 is the sum of these values, e.g., 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.3 = 5.0.
### Comparison Across Documents:

The same MaxSim operation is performed for Document 2.
Suppose the resulting similarities for Document 2 yield a score of 2.8.
ColBERT would rank Document 1 higher than Document 2 because 5.0 > 2.8.

#### Advantages of ColBERT

Efficiency: By precomputing document embeddings and using a late interaction mechanism, ColBERT allows for fast retrieval while leveraging the power of BERT.
Fine-Grained Matching: The token-level interaction captures subtle nuances between the query and document, leading to more accurate retrieval.
Scalability: It is well-suited for large-scale information retrieval tasks, where speed and accuracy are critical.
